Student Schedule Generator

The folder containing old files was the original version which broke and now refuses to load the stylsheets properly.
Some of the original files are not present in the folder and it does not function as a whole application anymore.

The frontend contains the angular application interface which interfaces the backend Flask python API.

In order to run the application we first navigate to the backend folder and run "./bootstrap.sh" to intitate the python 
envelope and then we must navigate to the frontend folder and run "ng serve" to launch the angular application.
