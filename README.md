# courseScheduler
Student Schedule Generator

The folder containing old files was the original version which has very little functionality and does little more than showing the schedule possibilities. This is version still has more functionality than the current version. To launch the original version navigate to the "oldfiles" directory and run "python3 main.py"

The frontend contains the angular application interface which interfaces the backend Flask python API.

In order to run the application we first navigate to the backend folder and run "./bootstrap.sh" to intitate the python 
envelope and then we must navigate to the frontend folder and run "ng serve" to launch the angular application.
